# TODO

'''
Welcome the user, find someway for the user to give the topic or photos/pdfs of what they're working with if they choose. 
Ask the user for a specific study method or a simple timer. 
Maybe a config for different study methods? ( This does this and that - Have them enter their choice via numbers or text ) - use.lower

When we're ready to begin, ensure we have camera access - Document in comments or somewhere to help the user solve the errors.

When we're started, say X photos a second or every few seconds -- We'll compare what we see with the trained model --
If user is caught using phone
  Work with arduino to play buzzer -- Are we doing something with the time?
else:
  Continue and play a task or loop to take photos and check.

While this is happening we either play the timer on the screen or just print every minute in the console. 

When we hit milestones (Specify in the config -- Tell the user they're doing)

Integrate ChatGPT into the code for checks of assignment and stuff - run this last.
