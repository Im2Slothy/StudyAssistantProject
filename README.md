# StudyAssistantProject

✅❌⌛(Done, Not Done, In Progress)

✅ Welcome the user
 
❌ find someway for the user to give the topic or photos/pdfs of what they're working with if they choose. 

✅ Ask the user for a specific study method or a simple timer. 
✅ Maybe a config for different study methods? ( This does this and that - Have them enter their choice via numbers or text ) - use.lower (DONE with IDs)

✅ When we're ready to begin, ensure we have camera access - Document in comments or somewhere to help the user solve the errors.

❌ When we're started, say X photos a second or every few seconds -- We'll compare what we see with the trained model --
❌If user is caught using phone
  Work with arduino to play buzzer -- Are we doing something with the time?
else:
  Continue and play a task or loop to take photos and check.

  
✅While this is happening we either play the timer on the screen or just print every minute in the console. 

✅When we hit milestones (Specify in the config -- Tell the user they're doing)

✅Integrate ChatGPT into the code for checks of assignment and stuff - run this last. 

Future ideas:
- maybe add microphone input for study method instead of typing/ID
- ✅ tie Arduino + camera into same loop as timer ( We are going to use the device camera per prof.)
- ✅ milestone notifications every X cycles ( Yay congrats, keep going!, etc etc)
